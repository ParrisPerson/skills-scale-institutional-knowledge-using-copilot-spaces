# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

## Project Management Process Summary

OctoAcme follows an iterative, customer-first approach to project delivery. Every project moves through a defined lifecycle—**Initiation**, **Planning**, **Execution**, **Release**, and **Retrospective**—ensuring that work is validated before it begins, delivered in small testable increments, and improved continuously after each cycle. Key artifacts anchor each phase: a Project One-pager captures the problem and success metrics at initiation; a roadmap, sprint backlog, and risk register guide planning and execution; release notes and a deployment checklist govern production rollouts; and retrospective notes close the loop with captured learnings and action items.

Five core roles collaborate throughout the lifecycle. The **Project Manager (PM)** coordinates schedules, risks, dependencies, and cross-team communications. The **Product Manager (PdM)** owns the product vision, prioritizes the backlog, and measures outcomes against success metrics. **Developers** implement features, write and maintain tests, and participate in design and code reviews. **QA** validates acceptance criteria and release readiness. **Stakeholders** provide strategic input and sign off at key decision gates, ensuring alignment between business priorities and delivered value.

Communication cadence is deliberate and structured. Teams hold twice-weekly standups and a weekly PM–PdM sync to surface blockers early. Monthly stakeholder updates maintain executive visibility, while a clear escalation path—team → PM → Product Lead → Sponsor—ensures issues reach the right decision-maker quickly. Weekly status reports follow a standard template (progress, next steps, risks, decisions needed) to keep all parties consistently informed.

Quality is built into every stage. Acceptance criteria and a Definition of Done are established during planning and verified before any story is closed. Releases require passing CI, security scans, smoke tests, and a documented rollback plan before deployment. Post-deploy verifications confirm production health, and any incident triggers a blameless retrospective to prevent recurrence. This disciplined release process—combined with ongoing risk monitoring and regular retrospectives—supports OctoAcme's goal of delivering reliable, maintainable software at a sustainable pace.
